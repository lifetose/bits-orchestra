This is my own solution to Bits Orchestra test task.

To run application follow next steps:

1. download repository (clone or download zip file)
2. install dependencies by open terminal in the same project folder with command npm install
3. run server with command npm run dev:server
4. run react app with command npm run dev.

Now you are ready to go :)
